# Budget Tracker
## Description 
​This application is a modified budget tracker application that allows offline access and functionality for tracking expenses and deposits to a user's finances. This application is perfect for travelers who want to ensure their account balances are accurate when traveling with spotty internet connection. Users receive notifications that transactions have been added with or upon reestablishing internet connection. The user is able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If transactions are entered offline, the total is updated when brought back online.

This project includes a Web Manifest as a mobile-first application to let users’ devices know what they’re installing and how the app should look on the home screen.
